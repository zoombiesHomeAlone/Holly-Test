Perfect — that’s a great creative twist. Let’s give Kevin a *zombie half-side*, which adds depth *and* makes the cybersecurity principles come alive (literally). Below is a revised **screenplay-style draft** for ***“Home Alone – This Time with Zombies”***, focused on ISO 25010–style security attributes: **confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, accountability, authenticity, and resistance** — all dramatized as plot mechanics and jokes.

# 🎬 **HOME ALONE – THIS TIME WITH ZOMBIES**

### *A Cybersecurity Horror Comedy with Brains (and Firewalls)*

---

## **FADE IN:**

### **INT. SMART HOME – NIGHT**

Thunder. Rain lashes against the windows of a futuristic suburban home.
Monitors flicker — firewall alerts, antivirus dashboards, live camera feeds.

At the center of it all sits **KEVIN SECURESON (12)** — smart, mischievous… and a *little undead*.
His left eye glows faintly green. His skin’s pale, but his brain is very much alive.

**KEVIN**
(grinning to himself)
If they say half-zombie kids can’t secure a home... let’s prove ‘em wrong.

He types furiously, coding into his “ISO Defense Suite.”
Each security module appears on-screen as a glowing icon:

* **Confidentiality Shield**
* **Integrity Scanner**
* **Accountability Tracker**
* **Authenticity Firewall**
* **Resistance Mode: ON**

---

## **INT. LIVING ROOM – MOMENTS LATER**

TV news blares:

> “ZOMBIE OUTBREAK: Digital infection suspected. Stay indoors and—”

*Signal cuts.*

**KEVIN**
(annoyed)
Even the news can’t maintain integrity.

He slaps a sticker on his console that reads:
**“Trust, but Verify – ISO 25010 Certified.”**

---

## **EXT. FRONT YARD – SAME TIME**

Two bumbling zombies — **ZOMBIE BOB** and **ZOMBIE LINDA** — approach Kevin’s fortified house.

**ZOMBIE BOB**
(chewing on a router cable)
Mmm… tasty bandwidth.

**ZOMBIE LINDA**
I smell... *credentials.*

---

## **INT. SECURITY ROOM – CONTINUOUS**

Kevin watches them on camera.

**KEVIN**
(grinning)
Unauthorized access detected. Let’s test confidentiality.

He hits a button.

The windows tint black, lights dim, and a digital voice speaks:

> “ACCESS DENIED. CLASSIFIED CONTENT.”

Outside, the zombies press their faces to the glass, confused.

**ZOMBIE BOB**
Confidentiality’s... so rude.

---

## **SEQUENCE: THE ZOMBIE ATTACKS (ISO EDITION)**

### **1. CONFIDENTIALITY**

The zombies try to peek in — Kevin deploys privacy curtains and encryption lasers.
Anything they see gets pixelated like a censored video.

### **2. INTEGRITY**

Zombie Linda tampers with a cable. The system detects a mismatch.

**KEVIN**
(typing fast)
Integrity breach detected. Restoring original configuration.

The wire magically reverts, sealing itself. A message flashes:

> “System integrity: 100% maintained.”

---

### **3. AUTHENTICITY**

A fake voice (Zombie Bob imitating Kevin) echoes through the smart doorbell.

> “Hi, it’s me! Let me in!”

**ALEXA 2.0**
(cheerfully)
Authenticity check failed.
Voiceprint mismatch.
Also… ew.

---

### **4. ACCOUNTABILITY**

Kevin rewinds the camera footage and laughs as the zombies trip into a moat of neon-green goo.

**KEVIN**
Accountability logs updated.
Evidence: embarrassing.

---

### **5. NON-REPUDIATION**

Later, Zombie Linda smashes a window and gets caught by a smart drone.
Kevin’s system prints a literal receipt that reads:

> “Zombie Linda attempted breach at 02:43 A.M. — signature confirmed.”

**KEVIN**
Now you can’t deny it.

---

### **6. RESISTANCE**

The zombies regroup for a final assault. They chant:

> “Brains! Brains! Root access!”

Kevin’s half-zombie side starts to glitch — he twitches, tempted.

**KEVIN (zombie voice)**
Must... share... data...

He shakes his head violently, regaining control.

**KEVIN (human side)**
No! Resist the virus! Maintain system stability!

He slams the keyboard. The **Resistance Mode** activates — blue energy surges through the house.

The zombies are blasted backward in slow motion, tumbling into the yard like rag dolls.

---

## **EXT. FRONT YARD – DAWN**

The sun rises. Kevin steps outside, holding a steaming mug labeled **“Encryption Juice.”**
Smoke rises from the lawn. His security system hums proudly.

**ALEXA 2.0**
All systems secure.
Confidentiality: 100%
Integrity: 100%
Authenticity: verified
Resistance: total.

**KEVIN**
(grinning, zombie half flickering)
Not bad... for a half-dead kid.

He bites into a cookie shaped like a brain.

---

## **ROLL CREDITS:**

Over a synth-pop remix of *“Stayin’ Alive”* by the Bee Gees.

---

### **TAGLINE OPTIONS:**

1. “Security’s in his DNA... and a little bit of decay.”
2. “Integrity never dies.”
3. “Half human. Half zombie. Fully secure.”

---

Would you like me to turn this into a **formatted short screenplay (10–12 pages, movie script standard with dialogue and scene headings)**, or keep expanding it as a **storyboard/pitch deck** with visuals and ISO 25010 tie-ins on each scene?
